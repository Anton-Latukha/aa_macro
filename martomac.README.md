# [martomac.py](martomac.py) -- Markup to `Macro()` format converter

use: `python martomac.py [-t ][-c ][-s ][-x ][-p ][-l ]markdownFile[.md] [macroFile]`

## Available options

Option | Effect
------ | ------
-t | generate `mtmtestfile.html` through `macro()`  
-o | open mtmtestfile in OS X default browser
-c | do not prefix with built-in styles (use your own!)  
-s | suppress generated blank lines between block elements  
-x | suppress filename report
-p | output goes to stdout
-l | strip tailing newlines from list elements
-d | dump canned styles to file "cannedstyles.txt" for your reference
-h | wraps content of "cannedstyles.txt" or stdout in basic HTML page
-m macroFileName | provide your own styles that may override the canned styles

## Some Examples:

### Normal use:

    python martomac.py README.md

Generates:

Output | Contents | Errors
-------|----------|-------
file `README.txt` | file ready for input to macro\(\) | **stderr**
**stdout** | Report of filename\(s\) to be used
**stderr** | Errors

### With addional test file output:

    python martomac.py -t README.md

Generates:

Output | Contents
-------|---------
file `README.txt` | file ready for input to macro\(\)
file `mtmtestfile.html` | output generated by macro\(\)
**stdout** | Report of filename\(s\) to be used
**stderr** | Errors

### Output convenient for pipes:

    python martomac.py -x -p README.md

Generates:

Output | Contents
-------|---------
**stdout** | text stream ready for input to macro\(\)
**stderr** | Errors

### Generate and view output with your browser:

    python martomac.py -t -o -h mtm

\(mtm.md is the test file I supply -- I'm still working
on compatability with less masic use of markdown. Mostly
it's order of parsing and the like.\)

Output | Contents
-------|---------
mtmtestfile.html | Opens right in your OS X browser
**stderr** | Errors

## Note

This task would ideally have been accomplished by taking the Perl
markdown-to-html generator and changing it to output a minimal subset of
macro\(\) code, as that would result in a far higher quality conversion;
one that does exactly what markdown does in the same contexts.

But I don't code in Perl any longer. I actually downloaded and looked at
the markdown Perl code, and all that did was profoundly re-affirm my
decision to to code in Perl.

So. If someone else wants to go after this particular bit of fruit,
which, if you're into Perl, you might even find to be low-hanging, by
all means do so and I'd be delighted to have it join the rest of this
fluffy goodness.

Otherwise you get my converter, which was seat-of-the-pants and probably
only works properly within the context of the most basic markdown syntax.
See the supplied [test file](mtm.md) for a quick look at what is known
to work.
