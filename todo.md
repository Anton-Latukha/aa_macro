Generally complete to description at (Github's Cheatsheet)[https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf]

## Github markdown processing

### Done:

* tables

### To do:

* task lists

### Punting unless use *on* Gitub seems possible:

* username mentions \(Only useful as stands on Github\)
* issue references \(Only useful on stands Github\)

#### Alternate Filter for Github?

Be nice if, when this is all said and done, I could have macro\(\) accepted
as one of Github's supported filters. Somehow I doubt it, as they really
lock down their HTML, but you never know.
