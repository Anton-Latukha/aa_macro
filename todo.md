# To-do

## Markdown-to-macro() Filter

Might be nice to be able to take a file that's been written in markdown format
and output it as compatible source for macro()

This would allow someone who has previously created some number of documents
to convert them easily, while making available to them the many advantages
that macro() has to offer.
