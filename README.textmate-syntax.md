# Textmate \(and presumably Github\) compatible syntax definition

[textmate-syntax.txt](textmate-syntax.txt) is what you need to
put in a Textmate bundle in order to display `macro()` source
with syntax highlighting.

Keep in mind that what this does is set up some of textmate's
pre-defined classes to go along with `macro()` syntax; the coloring
itself is matched to those classes in Textmate's preferences,
under "Fonts and Colors."

Here's how I have mine set up:
